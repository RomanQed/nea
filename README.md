Not Enough Aspects, simple add-on for https://github.com/Wong-Innovations/TC4Research

Adds a way to obtain aspects by drinking/eating essence concentrates. 
It also adds a medicinal concentrate that reduces temporary warp.

There are no recipes for all items by default, it is assumed that they will be added by the craft tweaker.
The reason for this decision is that each modpack has its own balance, and I can't find a recipe that 
would be ideal for your particular case.
